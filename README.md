# Flow

Flow is a full-stack app created by Roberto Lopez-Trigo, Juan Martinez Guevera, Mike Power & Greg King.

Flow helps the user create and record their own unique rap song in real time. 

Users select a beat track and choose whether to start with their own first line or ask the app to suggest a first line. 

Upon tapping start, the user will hear the beat track and beginning rapping. At the end of each line the app, 
using speech to text, will diplay the line along with suggested rhying words for use in the next or a later line. 

After finishing the recorded track of the user rapping will be digitally merged with the beat track and saved for 
playback and sharing on social media sites. 

The app will also feature a social media style feed the lists users and some of their songs. Each user will have a profile
that includes all their songs which can be played by other users. 

Users can 'like' songs and leave comments.
